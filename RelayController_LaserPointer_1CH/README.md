## 1CH Relay Controller with Laser Pointer
There are one relay and two LDR sensors. One of them activates the relay and the other deactivates it.  
MCU:		PIC16F877A    
Frequency:     	8MHz (External Crystal)    

Note: It's a easy project with PIC and was a prototype. Although this made using microcontroller but, it could be done with logic gates.  
Note: Included schematic and PCB layout with Proteus
